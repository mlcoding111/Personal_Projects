                <p> Energy in spirituality, refers to a widespread belief in an interpersonal, non-physical force or
                    essence. With that being said , you can believe it or not " Believers consider spiritual energy to
                    be of a different type than those known to science, and therapies involved are often classed as
                    alternative medicine.

                    Various ideas pertaining to spiritual energy have been postulated in various cultures.

                    Though there are varying approaches, energy therapies are typically based on the premise that - on a
                    fundamental level - everything in the universe is made of energy.

                    From this perspective, human beings are also fundamentally energy.

                    Theories of spiritual energy are not validated by the scientific method, thus are dismissed as
                    non-empirical beliefs by the scientific community ."</p>

                <h2>How can it affect our physical life ?</h2>
                Energy has both positive and negative impacts on societies. Access to abundant, affordable, secure, safe, and clean energy is beneficial for humans. But energy extraction, transportation, and use can have negative consequences to the health, environment, and economics of a society.<br><br> Moreover, relying on imported energy can create vulnerabilities to a nation's security. The impacts of energy decisions are not equal for all people. Poor or marginalized societies are more likely to suffer negative consequences of energy decisions because they have a reduced capacity for adaptation and they may lack negotiating power compared to wealthier societies. Therefore, vulnerable populations can benefit greatly from improvements in energy accessibility, safety, or affordability.

                This topic also raises the fundamental problem that the world is strongly dependent on a finite supply of fossil fuels.<br> As demand increases and supply becomes scarce, the problem becomes more acute, with potentially severe economic and social consequences. A large-scale transition away from fossil energy poses a great challenge for society
